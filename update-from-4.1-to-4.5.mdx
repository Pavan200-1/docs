**Android Module :**

On v4.15 we updated the Android SDK from 34 to 36 and also updated all the dependent libraries to work with the latest versions of Android Mobiles. 

To build or migrate the v4.15 Android Source code, We need to install Android SDK 36 and its tools in the Android Studio.

Please follow three steps to install the SDK 36 and its tools to build the Pocket App without any issues.

1. As shown in the official google website, we need to install the SDK 36. 
2. Open Android Studio and on the Menu, Select Tools --\> SDK Manager
