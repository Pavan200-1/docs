## How to Submit Your App To the Apple's App Store ?

After Completing all the App Configuration & Setup Process, Follow the steps below :

1. Your App needs to be run properly and be clean of errors (the red warnings). Make Sure every functionality of the App is working (Compare it with the Demo App if Needed).
2. Set up your Signing and Team information in Xcode.
3. You should keep your app version as 1.0.0 if you are publishing a new app (or remember to increment the build version if you are publishing an update).

## Publishing

To create the full app archive, you first need to select the **Generic iOS Device** from the list of simulators.

Now go to **Product** --\> **Archive** and let it bundle your app. This process may take some time to build your app.

Once this is done, the Archive window will open and this is where you can manage all the archives generated by Xcode.

Every time you select Archive in the menu, Xcode will bundle a new archive for iTunes Connect. If you have duplicates or older ones, just delete them from this list.

Now select the archive and choose **Distribute App**. You’ll be prompted to select the method of distribution

Once you have selected **iOS App Store**, it will go over a couple of checks and validations to make sure you are not uploading a broken app.

If something happens, there is a great chance Xcode will stop you here and you’ll have to go back to coding or adding missing assets like icons.

If Xcode doesn’t find anything wrong with the archive, the upload process will follow. Once again the upload time will vary depending on the archive size and your internet connection.

Once completed, you will see a final window like this. Congratulations\! Your app is halfway there to the iOS App Store.

## iTunes Connect / App Store Connect

You can finally close Xcode because our work on the app is over. Now open your browser and go to [iTunes Connect / App Store Connect]   https://itunesconnect.apple.com/login   and log in.

![Ios Publish 8 Pn](/images/ios_publish_8.png)

If it is the first time you visit this website, you’ll first need to be part of the Developer Program which costs $99/year, starting the day you paid for the membership. 

To publish an app, go to the **My Apps** menu and select the **"\+"** option to create a new app. For submit an update to an existing app, the steps are similar but instead of adding a new app, you’ll be selecting an existing app instead.

![Ios Publish 9 Pn](/images/ios_publish_9.png)

Fill in the information about your app and use the **“?”** button if you are not sure what Apple wants. The website is pretty straight forward too. At this point, you have to fill in all the informations about the app. 

The name, description, the category (to be placed in the App Store), the minimum age of the audience and a privacy policy and support URL. Incase if it asks for a log in, you should to provide a test user account username and password of the app for the Apple reviewer. 

The main page for the app description will be like below

![Ios Publish 10 Pn](/images/ios_publish_10.png)

Don’t forget to fill in the **URL** for privacy policy. IT'S IMPORTANT \!

![Ios Publish 11 Pn](/images/ios_publish_11.png)

Decide if your app should be available after the review process or set up a future launch date.

![Ios Publish 12 Pn](/images/ios_publish_12.png)

Set up the pricing (Go With Free) and also if you want to publish your app worldwide (or not)

![Ios Publish 13 Pn](/images/ios_publish_13.png)

The next step is to take care of the app screenshots, app icon and to select the build to publish. iTunes Connect asks for different sizes of screenshots for each device, So upload all of them.

![Ios Publish 14 Pn](/images/ios_publish_14.png)

Use  https://help.apple.com/app-store-connect/#/devd274dd925   to go read more about the screenshots needed by the App Store, especially if you have multiples sizes to cover like iPad, Apple Watch, etc.

![Ios Publish 15 Pn](/images/ios_publish_15.png)

Now it is time to add the build you exported from Xcode. The archive was sent via Xcode but iTunes Connect needs some time to process it.

<Check>
  Note : You'll also get an email when your archive has been processed and is ready to use.
</Check>

![Ios Publish 16 Pn](/images/ios_publish_16.png)

Once the Processing is complete, you'll have an option to the Version and Save it. Once Saved, the button **Submit for Review** on the top right of your screen should turn blue. 

Then Click on the **Submit for Review** button and **Thats it \!**

You’ll have a couple of questions to answer about your app :

![Ios Publish 17 Pn](/images/ios_publish_17.png)

After that, your app will be on the waiting list for the Apple’s certification and review team. Your app should now have a yellow tag like shown in below image 

![Ios Publish 18 Pn](/images/ios_publish_18.png)

You just have to wait now. The review process may take upto to 3 or 4 days ( App updates usually take a shorter time to review than a New App.) 

After your app is approved, you’ll get an email. It will be on the App Store \!
